## The Harry Potter Language Documentation ü™Ñ
This documentation serves as a guide for writing spells in the Harry Potter Language. The language is dynamically typed and comes with a VS Code extension for a complete magical experience.

### üßæ General
A program is a sequence of statements. Comments start with **#**. The **.magic** file extension is the official file type for all spells.

***Note***:  The language is case-sensitive, so **Scroll** is a keyword, but **scroll** would be a variable name.


```magic
# This is a spell
Scroll myPotion = 10
Revelio(myPotion)
```

### üì¶ Variables
Variables are declared using the **Scroll** keyword, followed by an identifier and an equals sign **=**.

```magic
Scroll myPoints = 10
Scroll favoriteSpell = "Wingardium Leviosa"
Scroll ingredients = [10, 5, 15]
```

### üî§ Types
Numbers (integers and floats), strings, lists, and functions are the core types.

```magic
Scroll myPoints = 10
Scroll studentName = "Harry Potter"
Scroll hogwartsHouses = ["Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin"]

# Magical Constants
Scroll isTrue = Lumos
Scroll isFalse = Nox
Scroll noValue = Obliviate

```

### ‚ö° Conditionals
The language supports a full conditional chain using **Expecto** (if), **Also** (else if), and **Patronum** (else). The **Cast** keyword must follow each condition.

For multiple statements within a block, simply place them on new lines. The entire structure must end with **Finite**.

```magic
Scroll housePoints = 75

Expecto housePoints > 100 Cast
    Revelio("Gryffindor wins the House Cup!")
Also housePoints > 50 Cast
    Revelio("A valiant effort! More points are needed.")
    Revelio("Let's add 10 more for good measure!")
Patronum
    Revelio("The hourglasses are nearly empty.")
Finite
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Built-ins
The **Revelio()** charm prints anything to the console.
The **Accio()** charm summons input from the user.

```magic
Revelio("Hello, wizard!")
Revelio("What is your favorite spell?")
Scroll myFavoriteSpell = Accio()
Revelio("Ah, " + myFavoriteSpell + ", a classic!")
```

### ‚ûï Operators
The language supports standard arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators.
``` text
+ - * / ^
And Or Not
== != < > <= >=
```
```magic
Scroll score = 100
Scroll bonus = 20
Scroll total = score + bonus
Revelio(total == 120)
```

### üîÅ Loops
Statements inside **Loop...Cast** and **Repeat...Cast** blocks are executed as long as a specified condition is **Lumos** (true).

Use **Evanesco** to break the loop and **Flipendo** to continue to the next iteration.

The entire structure must end with **Finite**.

#### For Loop (Repeat)
```magic
# Repeat i from 1 to 3
Repeat i = 1 Until 4 Cast
    Revelio("Stirring potion...")
Finite
```
#### While Loop (Loop)
```magic
Scroll i = 0
Loop i < 3 Cast
    Revelio("Casting spell number:")
    Revelio(i)
    Scroll i = i + 1
Finite
```
### ü™Ñ Functions (Spell)
You can create your own reusable spells (functions) using the **Spell** keyword.
Spells can take arguments and send back a result using **OwlPost**.

The entire structure must end with **Finite**.

```magic
# A spell to double a number of house points
Spell doublePoints(points)
  OwlPost points * 2
Finite

Scroll gryffindorPoints = 50
Scroll finalPoints = doublePoints(gryffindorPoints)
Revelio("Gryffindor's points have been doubled to:")
Revelio(finalPoints)
```

## üéì Quick Start: The Sorting Hat Ceremony

Let‚Äôs cast a simple, interactive spell where the Sorting Hat asks for your name and places you in a house.

1. Create a new file named `sorting.magic`.
2. Write your spell:

```magic

# The Sorting Hat Ceremony

Revelio("Welcome to Hogwarts, young wizard!")
Revelio("What is your name? ")
Scroll name = Accio()

Revelio("Welcome, " + name + "! The Sorting Hat will now decide your house.")
Revelio("Are you brave? (Answer with 'Lumos' for yes) ")
Scroll trait = Accio()

Expecto trait == "Lumos" Cast
  # You belong with the lions! ü¶Å
  Revelio(name + ", you belong in... GRYFFINDOR!")
Patronum
  # You belong with the snakes! üêç
  Revelio(name + ", your ambition shows you belong in... SLYTHERIN!")
Finite

```

### üêç The Muggle Equivalent (Python)
To understand the logic behind the magic, here is the exact same program in Python:

```python
# The Sorting Hat Ceremony in Python

print("Welcome to Hogwarts, young wizard!")
print("What is your name? ")
name = input()

print("Welcome, " + name + "! The Sorting Hat will now decide your house.")
print("Are you brave? (Answer with 'Lumos' for yes) ")
trait = input()

if trait == "Lumos":
    print(name + ", you belong in... GRYFFINDOR!")
else:
    print(name + ", your ambition shows you belong in... SLYTHERIN!")
```



3. Cast your spell using one of these methods:
   - Click the **Play button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)** in the top-right corner of the editor.
   - Use the keyboard shortcut:
     - **Mac**: `Cmd + Alt + R`
     - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Alt + R`

## üìú Requirements
- Python 3 must be installed and accessible from your system's terminal for the interpreter to work.
