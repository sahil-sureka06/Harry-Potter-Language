# Harry Potter Language Support

Welcome to the official VS Code extension for the Harry Potter programming language! Write and run magical spells in `.magic` files.

This extension provides syntax highlighting and the ability to run your code directly from the editor.

## Features

* Syntax highlighting for keywords, strings, and comments.
* Run your spell files easily using the Command Palette.

## Quick Start

1.  Create a file with a `.magic` extension (e.g., `my_spell.magic`).
2.  Write your code:

    ```magic
    # This is a spell to award house points
    PRINT("--- Awarding House Points ---")
    VAR points = 150
    PRINT("Gryffindor wins points:")
    PRINT(points)
    ```
3.  Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`).
4.  Run the command **"Harry Potter: Run Spell File"**.

## Requirements

You must have **Python 3** installed on your system for the interpreter to work.
