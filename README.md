## üéì Quick Start: The Sorting Hat Ceremony

Let‚Äôs cast a simple, interactive spell where the Sorting Hat asks for your name and places you in a house.

1. Create a new file named `sorting.magic`.
2. Write your spell:

```magic
# The Sorting Hat Ceremony

Revelio("Welcome to Hogwarts, young wizard!")
Revelio("What is your name? ")
Scroll name = Accio()

Revelio("Welcome, " + name + "! The Sorting Hat will now decide your house.")
Revelio("Are you brave? (Answer with 'Lumos' for yes) ")
Scroll trait = Accio()

Expecto trait == "Lumos" Cast
  # You belong with the lions! ü¶Å
  Revelio(name + ", you belong in... GRYFFINDOR!")
Patronum
  # You belong with the snakes! üêç
  Revelio(name + ", your ambition shows you belong in... SLYTHERIN!")
Finite
```

3. Cast your spell using one of these methods:
   - Click the **Play button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)** in the top-right corner of the editor.
   - Use the keyboard shortcut:
     - **Mac**: `Cmd + Alt + R`
     - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Alt + R`

## üêç The Muggle Equivalent (Python)

To understand the logic behind the magic, here is the exact same program in Python:

```python
# The Sorting Hat Ceremony in Python

print("Welcome to Hogwarts, young wizard!")
print("What is your name? ")
name = input()

print("Welcome, " + name + "! The Sorting Hat will now decide your house.")
print("Are you brave? (Answer with 'Lumos' for yes) ")
trait = input()

if trait == "Lumos":
    print(name + ", you belong in... GRYFFINDOR!")
else:
    print(name + ", your ambition shows you belong in... SLYTHERIN!")
```

## üìú Requirements
