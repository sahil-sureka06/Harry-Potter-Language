# 📜 Extension Graveyard ⚰️🪄  

Welcome to the hallowed halls where **my old VS Code extensions come to rest. Each `.vsix` file here is a ghost of a past version, sacrificed to the great gods of syntax and runtime errors**.

Each version represents me adding a new spell, fixing a bug I created while fixing another bug, and pretending I finally understood how `package.json works`.

   

### Inside the Crypt:
+ **`harry-potter-language-0.0.7.vsix`** → The current masterpiece (probably has a new bug I haven't found yet).
+ **Older `.vsix` files** → My past experiments in the dark arts of programming language design.

#### This repo is basically a Room of Requirement for my coding drafts:
+ **Every commit** = “Added one spell, broke two others.”
+ **Every update** = “Surely this version will work.”
+ **Every file** = A `.vsix`-shaped monument to my own confusion.

#### Enjoy the evolution of my magical creation journey! 🦉✨
