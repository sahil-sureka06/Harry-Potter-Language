# 📜 Extension Graveyard ⚰️🪄  

Welcome to the hallowed halls where **my old VS Code extensions come to rest. Each `.vsix` file here is a ghost of a past version, sacrificed to the great gods of syntax and runtime errors**.

Each version represents me adding a new spell, fixing a bug I created while fixing another bug, and pretending I finally understood how `package.json works`.

### Inside the Crypt:
+ **`harry-potter-language-0.0.9.vsix`** → The current masterpiece (probably has a new bug I haven't found yet).
+ **Older `.vsix` files** → My past experiments in the dark arts of programming language design.

### ⚡ Why is Version 0.0.8 Missing?
If you’re hunting for `v0.0.8` in this repo… stop searching, young wizard. 🧙‍♂️.

The number **8** is *notorious for being unlucky in the Harry Potter universe*:

- In *Goblet of Fire*, during the **final maze task**, Harry’s turn lined up with the number 8 — and it led straight to Voldemort’s return. ☠️
- Quidditch chaos also struck Harry around the 8th minute in an early match, nearly knocking him off his broom. 🧹💨

Unlike the lucky **7** (the most magical number), **8 brought danger and misery** whenever it showed up..  
So, in true wizarding spirit, I’ve skipped version 0.0.8 entirely. ✨

We move straight from `0.0.7` to `0.0.9` — because no one wants Voldemort hiding inside their extension. 🪄💻

#### This repo is basically a Room of Requirement for my coding drafts:
+ **Every commit** = “Added one spell, broke two others.”
+ **Every update** = “Surely this version will work.”
+ **Every file** = A `.vsix`-shaped monument to my own confusion.

### Enjoy the evolution of my magical creation journey! 🦉✨
